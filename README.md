## Transforming Meeting Recordings into Structured Articles with LLMs

 

Meeting minutes and transcripts often fall short in capturing the nuanced essence of discussions, losing valuable insights and key takeaways. Recognizing this, the goal was to automate the creation of structured articles from meeting recordings using Large Language Models (LLMs). The task involved developing a tool that streamlines information capture and sharing, saving time, improving accuracy, and maximizing the value of recorded discussions.

 

To achieve this, a system was built leveraging Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API for accurate transcription of long audio recordings. The transcribed text was then processed by Gemini Pro. The model identifies speakers, summarizes key points, and generates well-structured articles with headings, subheadings, and bullet points. A user-friendly interface allows for recording uploads, word count specification, and content review. The result is an automated process that transforms meeting recordings into informative articles, significantly reducing manual effort.
